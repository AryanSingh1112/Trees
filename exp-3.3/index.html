On GitHub, you can make a folder by creating a file with a **path**: go to **Add file → Create new file**, type `folderName/filename.ext` (e.g., `src/main.cpp`) in the filename box, add some content (or just a `.gitkeep` file if you want the folder empty), then commit — GitHub will create the folder with that file inside.
